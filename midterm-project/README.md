## Problem Statement

Heart disease remains the biggest killer in the UK - something that really struck me when I started researching this project. We're talking about tens of thousands of deaths each year, and the frustrating bit is that many of these could probably be prevented if we spotted the warning signs earlier.

The trouble is, working out who's going to develop heart problems isn't exactly straightforward. Of course, doctors have ways to test for it, but these tests are costly and take ages. Plus, most people don't even consider getting checked until they're already feeling rough. By that point, you're often dealing with serious damage that could have been avoided altogether.

I've been thinking about this problem from a practical angle. What if we could use the information GPs already collect during routine appointments to better predict who's at risk? Rather than waiting for someone to turn up at A&E with chest pains, we could identify potential problems much sooner. This would give doctors and patients a proper chance to take action before things get serious.

Using the Cleveland Clinic's dataset of 303 patients with comprehensive medical records, this project builds a predictive model that analyses factors like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other standard measurements to accurately assess heart disease risk.

## Project Goals

This project fulfils the requirements for the ML Zoomcamp Mid-Term Project by delivering:

- **🔍 Data Analysis**: Comprehensive EDA and data preprocessing
- **🧠 Model Development**: Training and evaluation of multiple ML algorithms
- **🐳 Deployment**: Containerised web service using Docker

- **Instances**: 303 patients
- **Features**: 14 clinical attributes (selected from original 76)
- **Task**: Binary classification (heart disease present/absent)
- **Data Types**: Mixed categorical, integer, and real values

### 🩺 Features
The dataset includes critical medical indicators:
